    Yes, the Gmag (green filter magnitude) from GAIA and V-band (visual filter magnitude) from Wright should be very similar/correlated. The green filter lies at the center of the visual band, so one would expect the G filter results to resemble V filter results. From what it seems, there does not look to be any outliers in this correlation. All of the magnitudes are quite similar to each other. As stated before, the Gmag gives the apparent magnitude through a green filter, and the V-band gives the apparent magnitude through a visual band filter centered around apprroximately 551 nm. If I were to look for outliers in the data, I would seek numbers that were either far lower or higher than the rest of the data or try and find places where Gmag and V-band are significantly different from each other.
